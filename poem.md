# Her Voice

## By Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde



*The* wild bee reels from bough to bough<br>
With his furry coat and his gauzy wing,<br>
Now in a lily-cup, and now<br>
Setting a jacinth bell a-swing,<br>
In his wandering;<br>
Sit closer love: it was here I trow<br>
I made that vow,<br>
<br>
Swore that two lives should be like one<br>
As long as the sea-gull loved the sea,<br>
As long as the sunflower sought the sun,<br>
It shall be, I said, for eternity<br>
'Twixt you and me!<br>
Dear friend, those times are over and done;<br>
Love's web is spun.<br>
<br>
Look upward where the poplar trees<br>
Sway and sway in the summer air,<br>
Here in the valley never a breeze<br>
Scatters the thistledown, but there<br>
Great winds blow fair<br>
From the mighty murmuring mystical seas,<br>
And the wave-lashed leas.<br>
<br>
Look upward where the white gull screams,<br>
What does it see that we do not see?<br>
Is that a star? or the lamp that gleams<br>
On some outward voyaging argosy,<br>
Ah! can it be<br>
We have lived our lives in a land of dreams!<br>
How sad it seems.<br>
<br>
Sweet, there is nothing left to say<br>
But this, that love is never lost,<br>
Keen winter stabs the breasts of May<br>
Whose crimson roses burst his frost,<br>
Ships tempest-tossed<br>
Will find a harbour in some bay,<br>
And so we may.<br>
<br>
And there is nothing left to do<br>
But to kiss once again, and part,<br>
Nay, there is nothing we should rue,<br>
I have my beauty, you your Art,<br>
Nay, do not start,<br>
One world was not enough for two<br>
Like me and you.<br>
